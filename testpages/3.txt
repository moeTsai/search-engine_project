It wouldn't be a parade without musicals
Joy Burton

What's a Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade without musical acts?

So far, we've seen hit numbers from some of the best on Broadway, including “& Juliet,” “Shucked,” “Spamalot” and “How To Dance in Ohio.”

The most recent group to dance across 34th Street was Marty McFly and friends performing an excerpt from “Back to the Future: The Musical.”

We were treated to some fun commentary at the beginning of the parade from Andrew Rannells and Josh Gad, the comedy duo who returned to Broadway this year with "Gutenberg! The Musical!"

President Joe Biden's Thanksgiving message: 'We have to come together'
Marlene Lenthang

President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden called in to the 97th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, imparting a message of gratefulness and urging everyone to share an act of kindness.

The two shared greetings with Al Roker over the phone.

"I think it’s important that we also commit to an act of kindness today," Jill Biden said. "Call someone and wish them a Happy Thanksgiving or do something kind."

Biden said despite divisiveness in the country and abroad against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war, "we have to bring the nation together and treat each other with a little bit of decency."

"We have to come together. We can have different political views but we have one view: The one view is we’re the finest, greatest nation in the world," he said. "We should focus on dealing with our problems and being together and stop the rancor."

Busy roads and crowded skies are as much a part of the holiday season as turkey and pumpkin pie.

And as travel industry chiefs hope to avoid the sort of meltdowns that have marred previous Thanksgivings, they are also urging the public not to resort to abuse when dealing with inevitable flight delays.

“If you’re flying, please be nice to your flight crew. They are there for your safety,” Mike Whitaker, the administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, said on X. “The FAA has zero tolerance for unruly behavior.”

Officials selected Alabama A&M University's Marching Maroon and White to lead the 11 marching bands in the parade, making it the historically Black university’s first band appearance in the event’s almost 100-year history.

The university’s Dancin’ Divas will perform with the band and again in a special performance with the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall, the university announced.

Carlton Wright, the director of the university bands, told USA Today that Alabama A&M applied two years ago. He learned the band had been accepted in February last year, and the Marching Maroon and White immediately began fundraising and rehearsing for the New York trip.

Seven new character balloons will take flight this year, alongside 18 others that have flown through the streets of Manhattan before. There will also be six “Balloonicles,” smaller balloons that will wheel down the route attached to cycles.

New balloons this year include a five-story-tall Pillsbury Doughboy, “One Piece” character Monkey D. Luffy and Po from “Kung Fu Panda” doing a flying kick. Fan favorites like Smokey Bear, Grogu from “The Mandalorian” and SpongeBob SquarePants will be returning.

This year’s parade will also feature four new floats, including a replica of Willy Wonka’s candy shop, a cityscape from “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” a 30-foot-tall gingerbread house and a replica of an outdoor campsite — sponsored by Snoop Dogg brand partner Solo Stove.

There are 2.5 miles of public viewing this year along the parade route. Certain areas aren’t open to public viewing.

Parade to feature 30 more minutes of entertainment and spectacle
NBC News

The Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade is a tradition that has long been synonymous with the beginning of the holiday season.

And this year, the event will run for 3½ hours instead of the normal three hours.

“This year, we’ve got more parade than ever before,” parade executive producer Will Coss told NBC’s “TODAY” show. “We’re going to start our parade at 8:30 in the morning, so we have 3½ hours of parade.”


What to expect from the 2023 Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade

He added that the parade is “the one time of year where we have three, this year 3½ hours, to all just take a beat, stand together, shoulder to shoulder, across New York City or the comfort of our living rooms, enjoy a little bit of spectacle, enjoy a little bit of tradition and enjoy a little bit of family, friends, love and community.”
